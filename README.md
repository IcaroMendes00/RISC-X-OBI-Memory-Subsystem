# RISC-X-OBI-Memory-Subsystem
This repository contains the implementation of a custom memory subsystem for a RISC-V core. The memory architecture was inspired by the PULPino SoC, adopting a modified Harvard model with a unified memory map, and uses the OBI (Open Bus Interface) protocol for direct communication with the processor.
